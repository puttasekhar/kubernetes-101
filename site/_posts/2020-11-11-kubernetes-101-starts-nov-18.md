Jeff Geerling is the author of bestselling book [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com), and streamed a very popular [Ansible 101](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/ansible-101-jeff-geerling-youtube-streaming-series) series earlier this year on his YouTube channel. Jeff is also writing [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com), and has maintained a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster for many years, the [Raspberry Pi Dramble](http://www.pidramble.com).

This series will cover all the basics of Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure, and will demonstrate how to manage containers, clusters, and applications running inside those clusters.
