The Kubernetes 101 YouTube series was so popular, I decided to translate everything into a short, concise book. The Kubernetes 101 book is the easiest introduction to container-based infrastructure.

All ten episodes of the video series are distilled into chapters to guide you through your journey starting out in cloud-native infrastructure.

You'll learn about containers, application deployment, scaling, and monitoring. And if you're looking for something a bit deeper, you can check out my other book on _automating_ Kubernetes, [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com).

### Updates Free Forever!

Just like my other books, I'll keep this book up to date as often as I'm able, and if you buy an ebook copy, you will get access to those updates free, forever!

Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way to push updates out to paperback users.
